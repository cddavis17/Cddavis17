        <h2>About Mental Health</h2>
        <p>
            Mental Health is often hard to talk about because in our society and others it is a heavily stigmatized subject. I go to a therapist and even I find it difficult to say what I really feel most of the time. However, talking to someone about your mental health is a necessity in my opinion. Otherwise your thoughts and feelings bottle up and eventually boil over, which usually doesn't end well. For this reason it is my opinion that mental health is equally if not more important than physical health.

            Personally, I suffer from multiple psychiatric disorders, but I'm always striving to improve my mental health. I'm usually more open about my mental health but in this case it's not something I want to get into. Although I would like more people to be more open about their mental health because it's important to stay mentally healthy. Bad mental health can and usually does have implications and consequences on physical health, on top of the psychological problems that come with it. I also wish more people checked on their friends more often, because you never really know when someone's struggling. Someone can appear happy on the outside but they could be dying on the inside, and someone checking in on them may be just what they need to let those thoughts, feelings and emotions out.
