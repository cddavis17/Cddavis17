    <h2>My Favorite Breed of Cat</h2>
    <h3>The Domestic Medium Hair Cat is My Favorite cat breed</h3>
    <h3>Although, Tabby cats are even better</h3>
    <p>I consider myself a cat lover, so I generally love all cats. However, medium hair cats hold a special place in my heart. My cat, Meeka, is a domestic medium hair and she is very cute and sweet. I had to take her to the vet today because she had an upper respiratory infection which concerned me. Don't worry, she's okay now, they prescribed her anti and pro biotics that will get rid of the infection. She is also a tabby cat which is something I'll elaborate on more in the next paragraph.</p>

    
    <p>Many people have misconceptions about tabby cats, the most popular one is that tabby is a breed itself. In reality, tabby cats are any cats of any breed or mix that have patterns of stripes and a distinct 'M' stripe marking on their forehead. The tabby coat pattern is extremely common among domestic cats, hence why I love them so much. Some may find my love for tabbies boring because of how common they are, but in this case I say it's the more the merrier. There are also various types of tabbies such as the Mackerel Tabby and the Classic Tabby. Their coats are adorned with beautiful stripe patterns and colors that give them a look of elegance and majesty, as befits their lot in life.</p>
