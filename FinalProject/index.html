            <h2>Introduction to The Elder Scrolls Universe</h2>
            <p>The universe of the Elder Scrolls is a deep and complex one with very convoluted and profound lore. The real life chronology of the games goes back to 1994, beginning with the release of The Elder Scrolls: Arena. This was followed by the release of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall two years later in 1996. The original games were a far cry from what they would become starting with and following The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The first two games were first-person adventuring fantasy games that ran in MS DOS. The second game, Daggerfall is still impressive to this day however, due to the incredible size of the map and the scale of procedurally generated locations in the game. The map of Daggerfall, which includes two regions of Tamriel, High Rock and Hammerfell, is nearly the size of Great Britain. The map comprises 62,394 miles of space, for comparison, TESV: Skyrim's map only spans 15 miles. You'll find below a map of the continent of Tamriel, the setting of all of the games</p>
            <img src="images/tamrielmap.png" alt="Map of Tamriel">
            <p>Each region of Tamriel is home to one of Tamriel's ten Humanoid and Elven races. High Rock is home to the Bretons, Skyrim is home to the Nords, Elsweyr is home to the Khajiit. The Sumerset Isles are home to the High Elves or altmer, Morrowind is home to the Dunmer or dark elves, Black Marsh is home to the Argonians. Cyrodiil is home to the Imperials, Valenwood is home to the Wood elves or bosmer, Hammerfell is home to the Redguards. The Orcs don't have their own province, but they mostly dwell in Orsinium in eastern High Rock and Western Skyrim. Each of these regions and their respective races have their own unique and interesting stories. Each of these races also has their own natural advantages and disadvantages. Below is a diagram of the listed races and their appearances.</p>

            <h2>Extra Information</h2>
            <p>
                Please see the about section for more information and lore. You'll learn about some of the other creatures and monsters that roam Tamriel and even the Aurbis(the in universe name for universe). The daedra page is particularly interesting as it details the (not all) dark gods of the Aurbis. However, if you prefer more holy and wholesome gods, visit the aedra page to learn about the nine divines.</p>
            <img src="images/Imperial_City.jpg" alt="Imperial City">
            <p>The above image is of the magnificent Imperial City at the heart of Cyrodiil during the late 3rd era. The white-gold tower can be seen towering over the massive city walls and architecture. It is the seat of the Elder Council and the emperor, who was dead at the time, meaning this image was obtained during the interregnum period which characterized the latter 3rd era.</p>
            <p>The background you see is one of High Rock's many castles and beautiful landscapes. High Rock is home to the Bretons, humans descended from mixed ancestry between Direnni altmer and their human Nedic slaves. This is my personal favorite race because they benefit from both Elven and Human traits. They are the best of the human mages because they have elder elven blood in their veins but, somewhat unlike the mer, they are still plenty naturally capable with conventional arms. This makes them the ideal battlemages, mages that mix the use of weapons in with their use of magic during combat.</p>
            <img src="images/isleofbalifera_adamantinetower.png" alt="Direnni Tower">
            <p>The above image is another building from High Rock, although it was not built by the Bretons. This is what is known as the adamantine tower, or Direnni tower, the oldest building on Tamriel. Nobody is entirely sure, but the tower is believed to have been built by the Aedra shortly following the creation of Mundus by Magnus and Lorkhan. It bears a striking resemblence to the white-gold tower in the center of the Imperial City.</p>
            <p>I have also attached some fantasy music to listen to as you peruse the site.</p>
