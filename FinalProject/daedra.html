          <p>
             The 17 Daedric princes are mysterious, powerful and often mischievous. They are the et'Ada who refused to sacrifice their divinity for the creation of mundus, and instead created their own planes of Oblivion. Daedric princes have many worshippers and cults all over Tamriel. There are provinces that tolerate it more or less than others. In Morrowind, daedra worship is technically heretical because of the common Dunmer worship of the Dunmer tribunal temple, but daedra worship is the old way for the dark elves and is still commonplace among Dunmer, especially outside Morrowind. Daedric princes are generally genderless, choosing to appear in either masculine or feminine forms. Different princes have different preferences but, with only a few exception, they generally stick with one or the other. The daedra are generally far more powerful than the aedra as they can directly act upon the world of Mundus, a capacity that the aedra are more limited in. The aedra have to limit their power because they gave most of it up when they contributed themselves to create mundus, the daedra are not hindered by this. However the aedra are not exactly weak, neither aedra nor daedra should be trifled with.

                    Azura is the daedric prince of dawn and dusk and she draws her power from these events. Her daedric realm is Moonshadow. She is generally considered one of the more just and benevolent daedric princes. Though her wrath is also swift and devestating when incurred. She has wiped out an entire race, the dwemer dwarves for trifling with her and striking the heart of Lorkhan. She also created the dunmer after their temporarily deified tribunal of Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil insulted her by becoming divine and mocking her. The formerly golden skinned Chimer were turned ashen skinned and red eyed, they were all simultaneously transformed into dunmer just as the dwemer had all disappeared after the battle of Red Mountain. You can find a magnificent statue of her below.

                <p>Boethiah is the Prince of deceit, secrecy, conspiracy, treason, and unlawful overthrow of authority. She is firmly in the category of evil daedra. Boethiah often holds tournaments among her worshippers to crown the victor of the deathmatch her Tamrielic champion. Boethiah is unisex and can appear as either sex. Oddly, the dunmer classify Boethiah as one of the three good daedra even though he is clearly not a good daedra. Although Boethiah seems to be connected to Boethiah by philosophy. See below a statue of Boethiah.</p>

                    Clavicus Vile is the prince of deals and bargains as well as power, trickery, wishes and serenity. His plane of oblivion is known as The Fields of Regret. Clavicus Vile often gives things to his worshippers and then takes them back later, renegging on his deals. He particularly enjoys toying with mortals and messing with them. He usually appears as a child accompanied by a dog named Barbas. Vile is often associated with conjuration as he often creates lesser daedra to do his bidding.

                    Hermaeus Mora is the formless daedric prince of knowledge and memory. His plane of oblivion is Apocrypha, an endless library with shelves and book piles stretching across the melancholy and bizarre landscape. The main method of accessing his realm is by reading certain black books.  His realm contains all possible knowledge and he draws from this knowledge always. Below is an image of the strange prince.

                    Hircine is the daedric prince of the hunt and the father of lycanthropy and werewolves. The Khajiit know him as "The hungry cat". Hircine's worshippers are often werewolves themselves. Hircine delights in the thrill of sending out his lycanthropic followers to hunt mortals. He is also the father of were-beasts in general such as wereboars, werebears, werelions and werecrocodiles. Hircine is generally one of the more accepted daedra, although lycanthropy remains extremely taboo to say the least. His daedric realm is known as the great hunt. Below is a depiction of Hircine.

                    Jyggalag is the prince of logical order and deduction. He is also the same god as Sheogorath, but Jyggalag was the original. He is said to, at any point in time, have taken account of every detail of every action that has ever occurred long before they have taken place. He was transformed into Sheogorath by an alliance of the other daedra, they cursed him to be everything he hated. Thus is the origin of the prince of madness, Sheogorath. Every era, Jyggalag returns in what is called a Greymarch on his shared realm of oblivion with Sheogorath, the Shivering Isles. He has yet to be successful in his attempts to dislodge sheogorath from his realm. Below is an image of Jyggalag.

He is the keeper of the sworn oath and the bloody curse that created the orcs. He is a member of the house of troubles in Dunmeri ideology. Malacath is also known as Malak, Orkey, the blue god and maouloch. The ashpit is Malacath's plane of oblivion, it is a desolate and unwelcoming place. Below is a statue of Hircine in Cyrodiil.

He was defeated by an avatar of akatosh who Martin Septim gave his life to summon using the amulet of kings. Mehrunes Dagon is ambitious and seeks to conquer Tamriel from its supposedly dead lord, Lorkhan. The oblivion crisis badly damaged all corners of Tamriel before it came to an end. Below is an image of Dagon.

He is also known as the webspinner, the spinner and the spider. His daedric realm is the Spiral Skein, a giant web of lies and manipulation. Although I refer to Mephala as a he, he doesn't have a gender and is androgynous. Mephala appears as different genders depending on who she's trying to trick. The Dunmer Morag Tong assassins venerate Mephala as their patron. Below is a depiction of Mephala.

She was also originally a magna-ge, one of the et'Ada who escaped Mundus with Magnus after the creation of Mundus. Below is a massive statue of Meridia.

These realms are represented by the golden saints and the dark seducers respectively. Every era, Jyggalag attempts to usurp sheogorath from his throne in the Shivering Isles, known as the greymarches. So far, Sheogorath has come out on top each time. Sheogorath is pictured below.
