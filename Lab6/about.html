            <p>Fitness is more essential to one's overall health than most people realize. This is one of the reasons that we face a massive obesity crisis in the United States. If people were more conscious of their fitness and health, perhaps the population at large would be healthier and we would have less obesity.</p>

            <p>That is the reason this website was created, to inform more people of the importance of excercise, a healthy diet and keeping those things consistent. The goal is to help more people understand that their health matters.</p>
